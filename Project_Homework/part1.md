How will you work? What tools will be used?

In order to work efficiently, our team will adopt an agile methodology approach. This approach emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and quick feedback loops to deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of our users. By breaking down the project into smaller, manageable pieces, we can adjust our development process as needed to accommodate any changes or unforeseen challenges that may arise.

To build our website, we will be using React as our frontend technology. React is an open-source JavaScript library that allows us to build dynamic, interactive user interfaces quickly and easily. With React, we can create reusable components that can be used across the website, making our development process faster and more efficient.

On the backend, we will be using Node.js, a popular runtime environment that allows us to execute server-side JavaScript. Node.js is well-suited for building scalable, high-performance web applications and has a vast library of modules and tools that we can use to speed up development.

We have selected SQL as our database technology because of its reliability, scalability, and strong community support. With SQL, we can create complex queries and manage large datasets efficiently, making it an excellent choice for our job tracking website.

To organize our workload, we will be using GitHub and Jira as our primary task management tools. GitHub will allow us to collaborate on code, track changes, and review each other's work. Jira will enable us to create and manage tasks, assign them to team members, and track progress over time.

To ensure that everyone on the team is working on tasks that match their skills and expertise, we will assign tasks based on each team member's strengths and knowledge. This approach will allow us to work efficiently and effectively and will help us deliver a high-quality product that meets our users' needs.

Finally, we will hold weekly meetings to discuss project progress, address any challenges, and ensure that everyone is aligned on goals. These meetings will enable us to stay on track and ensure that we are meeting our milestones and deadlines. We will also have periodic check-ins and communication channels on Slack to facilitate collaboration and keep everyone updated on any changes or updates.
